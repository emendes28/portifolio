== Description ==

The SEO Indexing module for Interspire Shopping Cart allows you to apply the canonical URL link element and robots meta tag within the <head> area of your HTML code. Each of these elements are designed to help search engines determine the most appropriate content to include in their index from your website.

In the options panel for the module, you can determine certain sections and pages of the website to apply the canonical URL link element and robots meta tag.

Please Note: this module will affect how search engines interact with your website. We highly recommend that you do not use this module unless you understand how it works. We also take no responsibility from negative results from using this module.
